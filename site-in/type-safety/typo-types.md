title: Typo types
---

Typo generates some helper types if they are needed by your database schema.

There are multiple reasons why this is sometimes necessary:
- PostgreSQL driver has broken handling of offset date/time types. need to go through string in order to not lose offset/precision
- money type is broken in many interesting ways
- possibility of transferring instances of a `Row` type to a platform which doesn't have the PostgreSQL driver jar available
- a type to hang otherwise orphan type classes on

## (In-)convenience
The goal here is type-safety, not convenience. 

You'll very likely map row types into your domain objects anyway, so mapping these types to what you want is typically trivial.
The row types belong in the database layer, and so do these Typo types.


That said, these types are primarily driven by the (self-imposed) constraint that typeclass instances be coherent -
That is only one instance per type. This may change in the future.

```scala mdoc
import java.time.*

/** aclitem (via PGObject) */
case class TypoAclItem(value: String)

case class TypoHStore(value: Map[String, String])
/** inet (via PGObject) */
case class TypoInet(value: String)
/** This is `java.time.TypoInstant`, but with microsecond precision and transferred to and from postgres as strings. The reason is that postgres driver and db libs are broken */
case class TypoInstant(value: Instant)

```

## Unknown types

You may also come across column types Typo doesn't know how to handle yet.
You will see warnings in the log at generation-time like this:
```
typo: Couldn't translate type from table pg_catalog.pg_statistic_ext_data column stxdndistinct with type Some(pg_ndistinct). Falling back to text
```

And then you'll see corresponding classes like this:
```scala mdoc
/** This is a type typo does not know how to handle yet. This falls back to casting to string and crossing fingers. Time to file an issue! :] */
case class TypoUnknownPgNdistinct(value: String)
```
