title: Comparison with jooq
---

- Typo is open source, jooq pesters you to buy a commercial version
- getting started is much easier with Typo's scala-cli script, you need to read jooq manual for a long time and manually
  copy/paste files, code and put it together 
- Typo is specific to PostgreSQL, jooq needs to cover many databases. postgres support must therefore be half-assed
-
