I've accidentally built a compilation benchmark harness for Scala 2 and 3 which can measure the cost (in compilation time)
for having a codebase full of implicits which need to be resolved. Read on to see the results!

<!-- truncate -->

## Background

Typo is a code-generation library for working with PostgreSQL in Scala.
You can read more in the [introduction](https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/).

It was built to replace huge swatches of boilerplate in applications,
as well as to provide sorely needed type-safety to avoid having to test everything.

A crucial design goal was to fit into your system such as it is.
This means it generates code in the shared subset between Scala 2.12, 2.13 and 3.x,
and for three different database access libraries.

### Typo output as a realistic compile speed test harness

In typical systems you may have a database layer, a business logic layer and a web layer,
with each of them occupying about a third of the code base.

The structure of the database and web layers are often very similar -
basically a bunch of case classes with type class instances and mapping code.

So let's say we take the database third of a typical system.
We'll use the fact that Typo can generate it in its entirety to build a compile speed benchmark,
where we contrast different combinations of scala versions and database libraries.

I'll stress that the code it generates is basically the same code I've written again and again over the years,
which should make the benchmark interesting since this is so close to real-world application code.

Let's see where it takes us!

## The generated code

If you're curious about the generated code,
you can expand this section to see some example code
for an email address table in the [AdventureWorks database](https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres),
generated for doobie.

import EmailaddressId from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressId.scala';
import EmailaddressRepo from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressRepo.scala';
import EmailaddressRepoImpl from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressRepoImpl.scala';
import EmailaddressRepoMock from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressRepoMock.scala';
import EmailaddressRow from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressRow.scala';
import EmailaddressRowUnsaved from '!!raw-loader!@site/blog/emailaddress/EmailaddressRowUnsaved.scala';

## Initial comparison of compile times

Each benchmark is run three times, and in the graphs you can choose to se minimum or average compile times.

<ScalaCompileTimesChart id="groupedBarChart1">{`
library,scala version, average compile time, minimum compile time
baseline (only case class),scala212,false,2346,2289
baseline (only case class),scala213,false,4273,2944
baseline (only case class),scala3,false,4319,3050
zio-jdbc,scala212,false,9484,8919
zio-jdbc,scala213,false,10094,9058
zio-jdbc,scala3,false,8954,7500
doobie,scala212,false,23452,22896
doobie,scala213,false,26086,25723
doobie,scala3,false,7862,7605
anorm,scala212,false,9912,9378
anorm,scala213,false,8900,8243
anorm,scala3,false,7645,7179
`}</ScalaCompileTimesChart>

"baseline" is generating just case classes, no type class instances or repositories.


We can make some observations right away:
- Scala 3 is ~always faster than Scala 2.12 and 2.13, only beaten by Scala 2.12 for baseline/just case classes
- doobie takes more than double the time to compile compared to anorm and zio-jdbc for Scala 2.x.
- zio-jdbc and anorm have similar compile times across scala versions.
- It's interesting to see the "cost" of adding type class instances and repositories

<br/>
<KeyTakeaway>
    Scala 3 is consistently fast! Great job Scala team!
</KeyTakeaway>
<br/>
The meat of this blog post will be to <b>investigate why the code for doobie takes so long for scala 2.x</b>.

## So what's up with doobie with Scala 2.x?

The issue is composite. Let's take the biggest issue first - Automatic derivation of type class instances!

Let's take something rather innocent:
<CodeBlock language="scala">{
`case class A(v1: String, v2: String, v3: String, v4: String, v5: String, v6: String, v7: String)
sql"select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7".query[A].to[List]
sql"select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7".query[A].to[List]
`}
</CodeBlock>

This will compile and work, but an instance of `Read[A]` will be derived for each of the two queries.

No problem, we're taught that we can cache the `Read[A]` instance in the companion object.
<CodeBlock language="scala">{`
object A {
  implicit val read: Read[A] = Read.derived
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

The surprise is that (as far as I understand) this does not actually work in this case.
Since the automatic derivation is put in implicit scope in the companion object of the type class, it will be found before our cached instance.
We actually need to specify the instance explicitly:

<CodeBlock language="scala">{`
sql"select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7".query(A.read).to[List]
sql"select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7".query(A.read).to[List]
`}
</CodeBlock>

And boom! We've solved the problem. I implemented this in Typo, and will refer to this as doobie with and without fix in subsequent tables.

## Results without accidental automatic type class derivation for doobie

Fantastic! We've cut the compile times almost in half for doobie for Scala 2.x - ten seconds is a lot of time if you suffer them often.

<br/>
<KeyTakeaway>
    Automatic typeclass derivation is a bad idea, but only for Scala 2.x!
</KeyTakeaway>
<br/>

But doobie is still a lot slower, so let's dig a bit further!

## Query interpolation woes.

So all of this extra time is spent in typer/resolving implicits. I wanted to see what could be done about it, and what causes it.

That's why I implemented an "inline implicits" mode for typo. I'll show a diff of what it does here, hopefully it'll be clear that it hardcodes some implicit resolution:
<CodeBlock language="diff">{`
+import doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment.fromWrite
+import doobie.util.Write
+import doobie.util.meta.Meta
class EmailaddressRepoImpl extends EmailaddressRepo {
   override def update(row: EmailaddressRow): ConnectionIO[Boolean] = {
     val compositeId = row.compositeId
     sql"""update person.emailaddress
-          set "emailaddress" = \${row.emailaddress},
-              "rowguid" = \${row.rowguid}::uuid,
-              "modifieddate" = \${row.modifieddate}::timestamp
-          where "businessentityid" = \${compositeId.businessentityid} AND "emailaddressid" = \${compositeId.emailaddressid}"""
+          set "emailaddress" = \${fromWrite(row.emailaddress)(Write.fromPutOption(Meta.StringMeta.put))},
+              "rowguid" = \${fromWrite(row.rowguid)(Write.fromPut(TypoUUID.put))}::uuid,
+              "modifieddate" = \${fromWrite(row.modifieddate)(Write.fromPut(TypoLocalDateTime.put))}::timestamp
+          where "businessentityid" = \${fromWrite(compositeId.businessentityid)(Write.fromPut(BusinessentityId.put))} AND "emailaddressid" = \${fromWrite(compositeId.emailaddressid)(Write.fromPut(Meta.IntMeta.put))}"""
       .update
       .run
       .map(_ > 0)
    }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

Here are the results with and without inlined implicits:

anorm,scala213,true,7622,7593
anorm,scala3,true,7050,6948
`}</ScalaCompileTimesChart>

This brings the compile time for doobie down to about the same as for anorm and zio-jdbc.

Great! So what is going on?

I honestly haven't dug into all the details, but I have a guess which looks obvious.
In order to interpolate values into an SQL query, doobie needs to resolve a chain of implicits instead of just one.

In order to interpolate in the `emailaddress` field which has type `Option[String]`, this thing needs to be resolved:
<CodeBlock language="scala">{`
doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment.fromWrite(unsaved.emailaddress)(
  doobie.util.Write.fromPutOption(
    doobie.util.Put.metaProjectionWrite(
        doobie.util.meta.Meta.StringMeta
      )
  )
)
`}
</CodeBlock>

I'm sure this can cause the compiler to spend a lot of time looking around the companion objects of
`SingleFragment`, `Write`, `Put`, and `Meta`.

<br/>
<KeyTakeaway>
Make the compiler's job easy! It probably shouldn't need to go through so many layers at all.
</KeyTakeaway>
<br/>
<KeyTakeaway>
Scala 3 must have some caching of resolved implicits that Scala 2.x doesn't have.
</KeyTakeaway>
<br/>

## Future work on benchmark

Here are other things things I've done to speed up compilation of generated code, based on observations as I was developing.
A future version of the benchmark could measure the effect of these changes as well. Reach out if you're interesting in contributing towards this.

### Avoiding anonymous classes
Let's have a look at the code for `doobie.postgres.Text[A]`, it's basically this:
```scala
trait Text[A] { outer =>
  def unsafeEncode(a: A, sb: StringBuilder): Unit
}
object Text {
  def instance[A](f: (A, StringBuilder) => Unit): Text[A] =
    new Text[A] {
      def unsafeEncode(a: A, sb: StringBuilder) = f(a, sb)
    }
}
```
Using `Text.instance` instead of `new Text[A]` saves some compilation time because it generates less bytecode.

If you're a library author you should consider adding such a constructor method.

### Avoiding automatic derivation of product type class instances
Typo reimplements the derivation of type class instances for product types, so the benchmark cannot measure the cost of this so far.
If you expand `EmailaddressRow.scala` above, you'll see that `Read[EmailaddressRow]` is always implemented as `new Read(...)`.

It would be very interesting to measure the cost of deriving this automatically as well, we just need to patch `Typo` to use `Read.derived` instead of `new Read(...)`.

### Avoiding type aliases
Doobie uses a pattern where `doobie.util.Read` is exposed as `doobie.Read` through a baroque mechanism:
```scala
package object doobie
  extends Aliases

trait Aliases extends Types with Modules

trait Types {
  /** @group Type Aliases - Core */ type Read[A] = doobie.util.Read[A]
}
```
Typo always generates the fully qualified name `doobie.util.Read`.
It would be interesting to measure if there is a cost associated with this as well.

## Final results and limitations

### JSON libraries
This last graph includes compilation time for three JSON libraries as well, basically just generating type class instances for them.
I excluded them for the text above since there was nothing interesting to say about the results.
You can see how "inline implicits" mode also speeds up compilation of these JSON codecs.

### Benchmark limitations
I think part of this improvement from "inlined implicits" is due to the fact that the compiler is a bit warmer the second time around.

Note specifically that we get faster compiles for "baseline" with "inlined implicits" mode, although the generated code is the same.

I didn't bother improving the benchmark more, because the interesting things mentioned above was very visible and consistent already.
