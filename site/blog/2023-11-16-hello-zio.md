Thanks to the efforts of Jules Ivanic in [PR #57](https://github.com/oyvindberg/typo/pull/57),
Typo now supports using `zio-jdbc` as a database library.

### Never heard of Typo? 

You can check out the [introduction](https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/).
Essentially it's a code generator for database access code, which makes PostgreSQL integration type-safe and wonderful to use.

### Maturity
Note that `zio-jdbc` is a bit less mature than `doobie` and `anorm`, so it's a bit more likely to be some rough edges.
In particular, it handles nullable values [imperfectly](https://github.com/zio/zio-jdbc/issues/188).
We fixed a bunch of issues while working on this PR, so it should be pretty close.

### Implemented missing features in `zio-jdbc`

`zio-jdbc` does not support postgres arrays, and it does not support
the [COPY API for streaming inserts](/docs/other-features/streaming-inserts).

Typo outputs code which implements both of these features.

This can likely be upstreamed as a postgres integration module in `zio-jdbc` at some point.

### Repository signatures

To give a taste of the code you'll get, consider this repository definition:

```scala
trait AddressRepo {
  def delete(addressid: AddressId): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, Boolean]
  def delete: DeleteBuilder[AddressFields, AddressRow]
  def insert(unsaved: AddressRow): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRow]
  def insertStreaming(unsaved: ZStream[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRow], batchSize: Int): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, Long]
  def insert(unsaved: AddressRowUnsaved): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRow]
  /* NOTE: this functionality requires PostgreSQL 16 or later! */
  def insertUnsavedStreaming(unsaved: ZStream[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRowUnsaved], batchSize: Int): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, Long]
  def select: SelectBuilder[AddressFields, AddressRow]
  def selectAll: ZStream[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRow]
  def selectById(addressid: AddressId): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, Option[AddressRow]]
  def selectByIds(addressids: Array[AddressId]): ZStream[ZConnection, Throwable, AddressRow]
  def update(row: AddressRow): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, Boolean]
  def update: UpdateBuilder[AddressFields, AddressRow]
  def upsert(unsaved: AddressRow): ZIO[ZConnection, Throwable, UpdateResult[AddressRow]]
}
```

Notice how the signatures use `ZIO`, `ZStream`, `ZConnection`.

### `zio-schema` is not used

We opted to *not* go through zio-schema for the generated code. It was not clear that it was possible to implement all
PostgreSQL features through `zio-schema`, and we wanted to generate code which is as [fast to compile](/docs/other-features/faster-compilation) as possible.

### Also support for `zio-json`

Typo supports generating [JSON codecs](/docs/other-features/json) for all the row types..
The PR also adds support for `zio-json`, so you can get codecs like this:

```scala
object AddressRow {
  implicit lazy val jsonDecoder: JsonDecoder[AddressRow] = ???
  implicit lazy val jsonEncoder: JsonEncoder[AddressRow] = ???
}
```
